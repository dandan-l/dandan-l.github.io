                👋🏼 Hi, my name is Dan Liu. I am a creative UX designer who
                advocates for empowering and intuitive concepts with my diverse
                skills in design, research, and programming. I am passionate
                about empathizing with users and incorporating their stories and
                needs, and I have a long-established design and research history
                working closely with users, non-profit organizations,
                researchers, and developers. Currently, I am pursuing a master's
                degree at the University of Colorado Boulder, working as a lead
                product designer for
                <a lang="en" target="_blank" href="https://www.peerbots.org"
                  >Peerbots</a

                🏙 I was born in Shenzhen, China, a place full of possibility. My
                childhood involved a lot of moving and change. These experiences
                help me easily adapt to new environments and develop a strong
                curiosity about the world. This curiosity inspired me to go on
                adventures in China, the United States, Japan, South Korea,
                Denmark, Germany, and Mexico. I believe that I should embrace
                new places and cultures while I am still young. During my trips,
                I had a lot of fun conversations with bus drivers about local
                culture.

                👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Even today, my parents don't have a computer at home. As the
                first generation in my family to go to college, I greatly
                appreciate the opportunity to receive an education and grow a
                deep understanding of today's technology. However, I take it as
                my responsibility to not exclude anyone who isn't skilled in or
                has no access to technology, so people like my parents don't
                have to struggle to operate a smart TV. I also have a grandpa
                who didn't have access to hearing aids until recently. My
                grandma has had to yell into his ear my whole life, and I truly
                hope that no new technology will make things less accessible for
                him. That's why I want to promote inclusive and accessible
                design concepts so technology won't be a barrier to anyone.

                🤤 Outside of work and school, I am a big fan of food. I enjoy
                trying new cuisines and restaurants and cooking my food.
                Ingredients include 40% recipe, 40% imagination, and 20%
                excitement to share with friends and family.
