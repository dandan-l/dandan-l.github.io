                Hi, my name is Dan Liu. I am a creative UX designer who
                advocates for empowering and intuitive concepts with my diverse
                skills in design, research, and programming. Passionate about
                empathizing with users and incorporating their stories and
                needs, I have a long-established design and research history
                working closely with users, non-profit organizations,
                researchers, and developers. Currently, I am pursuing a master's
                degree at the University of Colorado Boulder, and working as a
                lead product designer for Peerbots and a web development intern
                for Celestial and Spaceflight Mechanics Lab.

              <p>
                I was born in Shenzhen, China, a place that is full of
                possibilities. My childhood involves a lot of moving and
                changes. This experience helps me build an easy adaptation to
                the new environment. At the same time, being frequently exposed
                to the new environment, I developed a strong curiosity about the
                world. Driven by this curiosity, I spent a lot of time
                traveling. I believe that I should be on adventures to embrace
                new places and cultures while I am still young. So far, I have
                visited China, the United States, Japan, Korea, Copenhagen, and
                Germany. During my trips, I had a lot of fun bus rides chatting
                with the bus drivers about local cultures.

                Outside of work and school, I am a big fan of food. I enjoy
                trying out new cuisines and restaurants and cooking my food with
                40% of recipe, 40% of imagination and 20% of excitement to share
                with friends and family.

                I built this website with some help from my supportive friend,
                Casey Hunt, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
