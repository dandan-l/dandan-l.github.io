              <p>
                Due to the pandemic, working from home (WFH) has become a norm
                for most of the office workers and students. The remote working
                style significantly impacted our lifestyles, social
                relationships and productivity in many different ways. Some
                people consider it a positive change given that it offers
                benefits like less commuting, more time with family and flexible
                scheduling, while the others feel overwhelmed by extended
                working hours, reduced social interaction, worsened health and
                lower productivity. For this project, I want to understand
                office workers' and students' overall WFH experience and see how
                I can improve it.
              </p>

              <h3 class="bold">Solution</h3>
              <p>
                My solution to this problem is an app called Closeli that
                encourages neighbors and friends within the same community to
                socialize together with safety measures. The app provides
                opportunities for people who long for in-person social
                activities to effortlessly connect with others and take breaks
                from work.

                <h4>Interview Reflection</h4>
                <p>
                  I conducted 1-1 interviews with 8 people in 3 weeks. At the
                  beginning, I interviewed with close friends and took notes
                  using my computer. I realized that the information I gained
                  from close friends had a lot of bias. For example, some of my
                  close friends focused on impacts that are solely negative or
                  positive and easily made the assumption that I already knew
                  most of the context when they answered my questions. So I
                  intentionally interviewed people I wasn't close with later.
                  Additionally, in later interviews, I wrote down some key
                  points in my notebook instead of typing the entire
                  conversation later because I realized that taking notes on my
                  computer made the conversation choppy and unnatural.

                  Most of the interviewees only have a limited amount of time to

                  change. Sometimes they prefer to be alone, but other times
                  they prefer to have company. Interviewees also mentinoed that
                  they don't have close relationships with their neighbors, but
                  that they would like to get to know them better when they are
                  in a mood to meet new people. Sometimes they just want to
                  socialize with friends.

            After understanding users' needs and necessary features to include,
            I came up with my first iteration of the design. For this iteration,
            I tried to make the user flow as linear and straightforward as
            possible to offer clear guidance for potential users, especially
            users who aren't tech-savvy. Under this approach, I also offered
            flexibility for users to hide private information, opt out of data
            syncing and skip questions because I believe that users should have
            the choices to protect their data privacy and remain silent for
            information that they don't feel comfortable with sharing.

          <h2>Final Design</h2>
          <p>
            I was introduced to the interface on the left when I started working
            for Peerbots. The developer built the interface using generic Unity
            UI components. Here is my observation of this version of the
            interface:

              <p>
                After hearing testers' feedback and doing more research, I
                proposed some changes to the branding, user flow, interface
                styles, and instructions to make the product more accessible,
                user-friendly and inclusive. Here are the changes I proposed:
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Changed the brand name from "Neighborly" to "Closeli" because
                the trademark "Neighborly" has been taken by other products on
                the app store.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Reorganize the profile set-up and preference set-up screens to
                make this process more efficient and less overwhelming.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Moved the location request screen after preference set-up
                screens to give users more context of the product.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Changed interface colors to make it more gender-neutral,
                inclusive, and accessible.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Reworded some of the instructions to make them less lengthy and
                more perceivable for users.
              </p>
